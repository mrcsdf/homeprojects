Building a traditional brick pizza oven is a great project, and with firebricks, cement mortar, and insulation like vermiculite or perlite, you’ll have a robust and functional oven that retains heat well.

### Step-by-Step Overview:

1. **Foundation**:
   - Start by preparing a concrete slab as the foundation, about 6-8 inches thick. This ensures stability and safety for your oven. You can mix vermiculite into the concrete for extra insulation【8†source】.

2. **Building the Base**:
   - Use concrete blocks to build the stand that will hold the oven. Ensure the base is level and strong enough to support the weight of the firebricks and dome【9†source】.

3. **Oven Floor**:
   - Lay firebricks on top of a heat-insulating material like vermiculite concrete. Arrange the firebricks in a herringbone pattern for strength and better heat distribution. It's essential not to use mortar between these bricks to avoid contamination of the pizza【8†source】【9†source】.

4. **Constructing the Dome**:
   - Build the dome using firebricks, starting at the base and working in layers, gradually curving inward. Use refractory mortar (a mix of sand, Portland cement, lime, and fire clay) to hold the bricks in place. You can use a sand mold or a leveling tool to ensure the dome's accuracy【8†source】.

5. **Insulating the Dome**:
   - Once the dome is built, cover it with a thick layer of vermiculite or perlite mixed with cement to provide excellent heat retention【9†source】.

6. **Chimney and Finish**:
   - Add a chimney to vent smoke properly. Afterward, clad the dome with an additional layer of bricks or stucco for aesthetics and weather protection【9†source】.

### Material Purchase:
For firebricks, vermiculite, and other materials, you can check out local suppliers such as **Home Depot**, **Lowe's**, or **specialized masonry stores** near **Great Falls, VA**. These stores typically stock firebricks and refractory mortar needed for the build【9†source】【11†source】.

With this setup, you’re well on your way to enjoying delicious wood-fired pizzas in your own backyard!
